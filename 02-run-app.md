## Bat out of hell

Not completely without luck, you find that the previous developers have actually
    created README's for their code!

Try that and see how that flies for you.

### Task

- Build with `go build` in each seperater folder (look in the folders README for more instructions)
- Binaries called `backend` and `frontend` will be created
- Run both the frontend and backend with `go run frontend` and `go run backend` in the respective folder.
- Familiarize yourself with the application (frontend and backend, try to add a cookie and re-run the backend)

ðŸ’¡ If you're running into issues, try look into the README.md in the `backend` folder.
