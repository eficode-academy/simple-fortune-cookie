## Bat out of hell

Not completely without luck, you find that the previous developers have actually
    created README's for their code!

Try that and see how that flies for you.

### Task

- Install go on your cloud instance
- Build with `go build` in each seperater folder
- Binaries called `backend` and `frontend` will be created
- Run both the frontend and backend with `go run backend/frontend`
- Familiarize yourself with the application (frontend and backend, try to add a cookie and re-run the backend)
