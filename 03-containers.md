## I'll pack my bags and go

Managing dependencies is annoying, what's installed where and in which version?

It is tedious to set up each system that you want to run on.

Luckily you know how to use Docker!

### Task

For both front and backend:

- Create a `Dockerfile` containing your application code and requirements
- Build the Docker image
- Run the application in Docker with a docker-compose file
- Check Dockerfile and compose file into your repository.

Extra:
- Use a multi-stage build to reduce the size of the image.
