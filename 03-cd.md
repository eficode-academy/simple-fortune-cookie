## Cut out the boring stuff

Every time that release time comes around, you get uncomfortable.
You do not feel safe about deploying to production.
Deploying by hand always feels like that nothing is entirely the same each time.

Guess it's time to script continuous delivery?

### Task

- Set up your server as a GitHub Runner
- Create a script that runs the application on your server.
- Augment your script such that you can deploy multiple versions
    ( eg. development, staging, production ), depending on the PR branch name

## Extra: Vulnerability Concerns

Your workflow now executes code on the server.
You're in a public repository, because you've forked one,
meaning that, anyone can fork your repository as well.

If you fork a repository, you can make changes, and pull-requests,
and oh no... execute arbitrary code on your server? ðŸ˜±

- Look into the `Settings / Actions` and discus why this is/is not a problem.
